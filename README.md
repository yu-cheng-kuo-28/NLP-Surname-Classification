# NLP-Surname-Classification

***A mini project implementing MLP, CNN, RNN with PyTorch***

**Keywords**: Natural Language Processing(NLP), text mining, classification, Multilayer Perceptron(MLP), Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)

- The code mainly comes from the book **Rao, D. & McMahan, B. (2019). Natural Language Processing with PyTroch. California, CA: O'Reilly Media**. Based on that, I ***tuned the model and visualize the outcomes***. 
- This was actually my final project of the *graduate level* course ***"PyTorch and Machine Learning"*** of *department of MIS* in NCCU. In addition, I got ***89 (A)*** in this course.

## (1) Dataset

>  The surname dataset, a collection of 10,000 surnames from 18 different nationalities collected by the authors from different name sources on the Internet. We split the data into 70% training data, 15% validation data, and 15% test data.


## (2) Data Preprocessing

- First, we split the surname dataset into 70% training data, 15% validation data and 15% test data. \
- Next, we vectorize the surnames using one-hot encoding. We utilize two variants — “collapsed one-hot vector” and “one-hot matrix.” We use “collapsed one-hot vector” in MLP to save running time, and use “one-hot matrix” in CNN & RNN. \
- In short, “collapsed one-hot vector” doesn’t retain the sequential information and only gives the Boolean values of a character appears or not , whereas “one-hot matrix” records the sequential information.

## (4) Model Introduction & Baseline Model

### 4-1 Model Introduction
• Neuron: Minimum unit of neural network. \
• Perceptron: A single-layer neural network. \
• FNN(feedforward neural network): MLP(multilayer perceptron, also called “fully-connected” network), CNN(convolutional neural network). \
• RNN(recurrent neural network): RNN, LSTM(long short-term memory), GRU(gated recurrent unit). 

### 4-2 Baseline Model
We utilize the exactly the same models of MLP & CNN retrieved from the book as the baseline models of MLP & CNN respectively. As for RNN, we do the same thing but slight adjust the drop probability from 50% to 0% since 0% yield better performance.
